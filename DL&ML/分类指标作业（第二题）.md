# 分类指标作业（第二题）

### 题目
给定完整数据集，分别计算在使用完整数据集的10%,30%,50%,80%,100%数据时的查准率、查全率，f1度量和ROC，使用折线图表现出这些指标的变化情况，并画出在不同数据量下的ROC曲线

### 加载数据集


```python
import os
import random
def get_dataset():
    data = []
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk('../dataset/aclImdb/neg'):
        for file in files:
            realpath = os.path.join(root, file)
            with open(realpath, errors='ignore') as f:
                data.append((f.read(), 0))
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(r'../dataset/aclImdb/pos'):
        for file in files:
            realpath = os.path.join(root, file)
            with open(realpath, errors='ignore') as f:
                data.append((f.read(), 1))
    random.shuffle(data)

    return data
```


```python
data = get_dataset()
data[:2]
```




    [('Unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14 (except for the R rating), there are very few things to like here. One or two lines from Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we really should see him more) and Sam Jackson are humorous and Julianna Margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings, but sadly, that\'s it. Poor plot. Poor acting. Worse writing and delivery. The special effects are dismal. As much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke, the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible. If we consider the action portions, well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan. This movie only contains the latter kind. This leaves little left. I\'m so glad I did not pay for this.<br /><br />Despite any hype, I can read and think, so as I sat down to watch, I did not expect anything good. I had no expectations, but was somewhat worried going in. Yet, like a train wreck, one cannot merely look away. And even with no expectations, I was let down. Bad. Not even \'so bad, it\'s good\' material. I\'m _very_ tolerant of bad movies, but this makes "Six String Samurai" (which I liked) Oscar worthy.<br /><br />No, this piece of over CGI\'d rubbish is in the same company as Battlefield Earth, Little Man and Gigli. How this is currently rated a 7.2 completely mystifies me. Brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all that I can think of as answers.<br /><br />I could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight, I witnessed a train wreck. I need to go wash my eyes. 1 of 10',
      0),
     ("BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD starts off promisingly, setting up a simple heist that goes awry, told from varying perspectives (in RASHOMON style). At around the hour mark, Sidney Lumet transforms this film into something that is so much more than the sum of its parts; it eventually morphs into a multi-faceted family drama, exploring the full realm of human emotions/relations, as the story comes to its chilling climax.<br /><br />As is the case with Lumet, he manages to coax exceptional performances out of his star-studded cast, without any notion of over-acting or hyperbole. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious, and interesting character, and oftentimes dwarfs Ethan Hawke, who plays his brother, Hank. That's not to say that Hawke is not bad; in fact he is quite above adequate, in a troubled role that suits his style. Marisa Tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance (the fact that she bares her flesh adds to this). Albert Finney's character (Andy and Hank's father) is the most intriguing, and in my opinion, he deserved a bit more screen-time. Amy Ryan also performs her job adequately.<br /><br />BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD is not an exceptional movie, but it proves that Lumet is still near the top of his game at the (apparent) twilight of an illustrious career. Many of his characteristics and trademarks appear here, not least of which involves the use of his characters. Infused with a killer script (no pun intended), smart dialogue and pacing, and a decent score, BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD is a must-see. A truly underrated gem. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Should just enter my Top 250 at 248. Highly recommended.",

### 按7：3划分数据集


```python
def train_and_test_data(data_):
    filesize = int(0.7 * len(data_))
    # 训练集和测试集的比例为7:3
    train_data_ = [each[0] for each in data_[:filesize]]
    train_target_ = [each[1] for each in data_[:filesize]]

    test_data_ = [each[0] for each in data_[filesize:]]
    test_target_ = [each[1] for each in data_[filesize:]]

    return train_data_, train_target_, test_data_, test_target_
```


```python
train_data, train_target, test_data, test_target = train_and_test_data(data)
```

### 定义分类器


```python
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer, HashingVectorizer, CountVectorizer
from sklearn import metrics
from sklearn.naive_bayes import BernoulliNB

nbc = Pipeline([
    ('vect', TfidfVectorizer()),
    ('clf', MultinomialNB(alpha=1.0)),
])
nbc.fit(train_data, train_target)    #训练我们的多项式模型贝叶斯分类器
predict = nbc.predict(test_data)  #在测试集上预测结果
y_score = nbc.fit(train_data, train_target).predict_proba(test_data)
print(y_score)
count = 0                                      #统计预测正确的结果个数
for left , right in zip(predict, test_target):
      if left == right:
            count += 1
print(count/len(test_target))
